## Why AGIFLow?


[<img src="./docs/overview.png">](https://www.loom.com/share/d2e4fcb3b7c847ec8bc752f48a644570)


With automatic logging and detailed traces, AGIFlow optimizes performance and resolves issues efficiently. Additionally, its intuitive dashboards accelerate QA and feedback loops, boosting team productivity and reducing training time. We understand the challenges of bringing your LLM app to production and want to ensure you have a [scalable, trustworthy infrastructure](./docs/architecture.md) to do so.

## Getting Started

Running Agiflow app locally using `docker compose` and start tracing your application by:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AgiFlow/agiflow-sdks.git
cd agiflow-sdks
```

2. **Run the development app**: 
```bash
cd dockers/dev
docker-compose up
```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
Go to `localhost:3000` to get the API key and follow [this documentation](https://docs.agiflow.io/python) to get telemetry from your LLM app to Agiflow dashboard. With `docker compose` development setup, the `AGIFLOW_API_ENDPOINT` is `http://localhost:3000/api/analytics`.

## Key Features

Our mono-repo is designed with the goal of building robust and scalable LLM ops platform. To learn more about why and how we use mono-repo, please visit [Nx, PNPM and Poetry Mono-Repo documentation](./docs/mono-repo.md).  

We're making sources available on a rolling basis from our internal repo. For comprehensive documentation, please visit [AGIFlow's docs](https://docs.agiflow.io). Here is an overview of our packages:

- [x] **dockers**: Docker compose to run and self-host AGIFlow.
- [x] **[llm-mocks](https://docs.agiflow.io/llm-mocks)**: Mocking library for LLM providers, simplifying TDD, reducing CI/CD costs on regression testing, and facilitating API development.
- [x] **[agiflow-eval](https://docs.agiflow.io/python-agiflow-eval)**: Python SDK for LLM evaluations, supporting custom templates and multiple models.
- [x] **[agiflow-sdk](https://docs.agiflow.io/python)**: Python SDK built on top of Open-Telemetry to collect LLM metrics, supporting prompt and model registry synchronization for multiple LLM usages.
- [ ] **[@agiflow/js-sdk](https://docs.agiflow.io/web)**: Web SDK for frontend analytics on how users interact with LLM apps, allowing full-stack traceability.
- [ ] **[@agiflow/web-feedback](https://docs.agiflow.io/web/feedback)**: Feedback widget with session replay and workflow visualization to get high-quality feedback from simple chat apps to complex agentic workflows.
